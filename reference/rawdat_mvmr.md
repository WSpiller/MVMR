# Raw multivariable MR summary data using lipid fractions as exposures and systolic blood pressure as an outcome.

A dataset containing summary data on 145 genetic variants associated
with either low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein
(HDL), or triglycerides. Data includes variant rsid numbers,
associations with each lipid fraction, the associations between genetic
variants and systolic blood pressure, and corresponding standard errors.

## Usage

``` r
rawdat_mvmr
```

## Format

A data frame with 145 rows and 9 variables. A full description of the
data is available by using the command
