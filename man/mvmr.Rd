\usage{
mvmr(r_input, gencov, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_input}{A formatted data frame using the \code{format_mvmr} function.}

\item{gencov}{Calculating heterogeneity statistics requires the covariance between the effect of the genetic variants on each exposure to be known. This can either be estimated from individual level data, be assumed to be zero, or fixed at zero using non-overlapping samples of each exposure GWAS. A value of \code{0} is used by default.}

\item{weights}{A value specifying the inverse variance weights used to calculate IVW estimate and Cochran's Q statistic. Currently only first order weights are available (\code{1}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"MVMRIVW"} containing the following components:\describe{
\item{\code{summary}}{A summary of the MVMR regression model, including estimated coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, p-values, and heterogeneity statistics.}
\item{\code{coef}}{The estimated coefficients, their standard errors, t-statistics, and corresponding (two-sided) p-values.}
\item{\code{Q_strength}}{A data frame displaying modified Cochran's Q statistics for assessing instrument strength with respect to each exposure. The Q-statistic increases proportionally with instrument strength, and analogous to univariate MR analyses, a value equal to or greater than 10 can be used as a minimum threshold for instrument strength. Note that for these statistics it is not informative to evaluate p-values.}
\item{\code{Q_valid}}{A modified form of Cochran's Q statistic measuring heterogeneity in causal effect estimates obtained using each genetic variant. Observed heterogeneity is indicative of a violation of the exclusion restriction assumption in MR (validity), which can result in biased effect estimates.}
\item{\code{p_valid}}{A p-value corresponding to the heterogeneity measure for instrument validity (\code{Q_valid})}
}
}
\description{
Fits an IVW multivariable Mendelian randomization model using first order weights. The function returns an object of class \code{"MVMRIVW"}, containing regression estimates, estimated heterogeneity as a measure of instrument strength (\code{Q_strength}), and estimated heterogeneity as a measure of instrument validity (\code{Q_valid}).
