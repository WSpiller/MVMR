\usage{
qhet_mvmr(r_input, pcor, CI, iterations)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_input}{A formatted data frame using the \code{format_mvmr} function or an object of class \code{MRMVInput} from \code{\link[MendelianRandomization:mr_mvinput]{MendelianRandomization::mr_mvinput}}}

\item{pcor}{A phenotypic correlation matrix including the correlation between each exposure included in the MVMR analysis.}

\item{CI}{Indicates whether 95 percent confidence intervals should be calculated using a non-parametric bootstrap.}

\item{iterations}{Specifies number of bootstrap iterations for calculating 95 percent confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
An dataframe containing effect estimates with respect to each exposure.
}
\description{
Fits a multivariable Mendelian randomization model adjusting for weak instruments. The functions requires a formatted dataframe using the \code{format_mvmr} function, as well a phenotypic correlation matrix \code{pcor}. This should be obtained from individual level
phenotypic data, or constructed as a correlation matrix where correlations have previously been reported. Confidence intervals are calculated using a non-parametric bootstrap.
By default, standard errors are not produced but can be calculated by setting \code{se = TRUE}. The number of bootstrap iterations is specified using the \code{iterations} argument.
Note that calculating confidence intervals at present can take a substantial amount of time.
