\usage{
strhet_mvmr(r_input, gencov)
}
\arguments{
\item{r_input}{r_input A formatted data frame using the \code{format_mvmr} function.}

\item{gencov}{Calculating heterogeneity statistics requires the covariance between the effect of the genetic variants on each exposure to be known. This can either be estimated from individual level data, be assumed to be zero, or fixed at zero using non-overlapping samples of each exposure GWAS. A value of \code{0} is used by default.}
}
\value{
A dataframe showing the conditional F-statistic for each exposure.
}
\description{
Calculates the conditional F-statistic for assessing instrument strength in two sample summary multivariable Mendelian randomization through minimisation of Q-statistics.
The function takes a formatted dataframe as an input, obtained using the function \code{format_mvmr}. Additionally, covariance matrices
 for estimated effects of individual genetic variants on each exposure can also be provided. These can be estimated using external data by
 applying the \code{snpcov_mvmr} or \code{phenocov_mvmr} functions, are input manually. The function returns a dataframe including the conditional
 F-statistic with respect to each exposure. A conventional F-statistic threshold of 10 is used in basic assessments of instrument strength.
