# MVMR

## Installation

MVMR can be installed from the [MRCIEU
R-Universe](https://mrcieu.r-universe.dev/) with

``` r
install.packages("MVMR", repos = c("https://mrcieu.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

To install `MVMR` directly from the GitHub repository, first make sure
you have the `remotes` package installed:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
```

Then the `MVMR` package can be installed using:

``` r
library(remotes)
install_github("WSpiller/MVMR", build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"), build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

To update the package just run that command again.

## Description

We have written the `MVMR` R package to perform multivariable Mendelian
randomization analyses, including heterogeneity statistics for assessing
instrument strength and validity. The package accommodates any number of
exposures greater than 1, and is currently includes a range of functions
for estimating causal effects, as well as assessing conditional
instrument strength and pleiotropic bias. For a detailed description
regarding each function, please install the package and input
[`vignette("MVMR")`](https://wspiller.github.io/MVMR/articles/MVMR.md)
